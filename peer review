What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
The description really brings the game to life. It's a key element in making the game entertaining and challenging.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
I like the way the game descriptives appealed to the senses.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
They could include more detail in the actual gameplay like introducing challenges or tasks to accomplish. It might also be effective to add in inventory, move counting, or point counting. 
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
The descriptives are a little too much at times and the overuse of elaborate words can distract from what the programmer is trying to communicate. 
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
No the code was straight forward.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Kind of? It has the appropriate license but the name and year isn't included. It does say boxing cactus though so that's kind of a name. 
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
The read.me itself is very cut and dry - sort of like the game. The programmer could add information about the dragon and give it a background story since the entirely of the game centers around its den. 
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
I really liked how I didn't run into any issues with the actual gameplay. My own game was very frustrating because of gameplay complications. Also, the creativity with the environment was awesome.
